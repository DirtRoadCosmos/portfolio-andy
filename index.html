                <p>Dear Members of the Peer Review Committee,</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my application for an additional endorsement on my Vermont Teaching License. I've been teaching Computer Science courses for almost two years now with a provisional license and in that time I've thought often about how fortunate I am to have an opportunity to teach in this subject area.</p>
                <p>Before this current teaching gig, I worked in software engineering and technical training for 10 years at TomTom, a digital map-making company in Lebanon, NH. Prior to that I worked in education in a variety of roles. All along I've enjoyed my work, but it's only now that I am convinced I've found "what I want to do when I grow up."
                </p>
                <p>While I like to think I offer meaningful learning experiences to my students, I no doubt still have a lot to learn about how to do this job. I am a reflective teacher and learner, and I enjoy having conversations with colleagues and supervisors about how to improve my practice. Compiling this portfolio has helped me realize strengths and weaknesses. This type of metacognition has been supported by an intensive, long-term professional development series with my colleagues in the math department. And in parallel I've been an contributor to the #ObserveMe movement at my school, in which many of us teachers invite each other to drop into our classes any time to watch and give us feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm look forward to meeting you at my Peer Review Interview. If you have any questions in the mean time, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you again for you time and consideration.
                </p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>

              I have a long career in many aspeects of software engineering. As a specifications engineer at TomTom my responsibilities included designing data models for various aspects of the global road network and international addressing structures. For example I spent time working on how to represent residential and business addresses as independent point features as well as as attributes of linear road features, and how to ensure consistency between those two different representations. This required developing data structures to support the comparison of these features and algorithms for detecting suspicious differences. I worked on a daily basis with UML object diagrams and class diagrams. Often this work was done in interdisciplinary teams, in which we worked through many of the challenges of modeling complex real-world features, attributes, and relationships.

            <p>
              I also work on various personal side projects in programming. One recent project I created is a website called baseballstreaks.com. This website sits on an application that reads a data feed from Major League Baseball and displays win streak information for teams.

              Fluency in at least two high level languages used in current pedagogy

          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>
              Over the years I've developed fluency in python, Java, and Javascript. And through personal study over the last year I've developed skills with Scheme-based languages such as OCaml. Fluency for me means being able to write code that speeds up human workflows, and to write that code faster than it would take to do the human actions. At TomTom there were lots of manual problems that needed to be automated. Below are two examples. In one case we were working with shapefiles (which is a geographic data file format) that were too large, and they needed to be broken down into smaller files. So I wrote a script to automate this task. A fluent programmer can see the problem, and sit down to write a solution. A non-fluent programmer would need lots of time to learn how to write the solution, then additional time to do lots of syntax look-ups in order to write the code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fluency also means being able to build off of other people's ideas. This is what I did in the Shape of Fractions code. I heard about this idea in a TED Talk and wanted to try to code it in Processing with Java. A fluent programmer can bring someone else's idea to life, without being forced to shrink or compartmentalize the idea into something the programmer knows how to deal with. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Fluency also requires a depth of experience with a topic. For the final project in my OCaml course we were required to build an interpreter. This experience forced me to become familiar with the language at a deep level, in a way that allows me now to operate more fluidly in the language, which is especially evident in the troubleshooting support I can provide to students now.

              I have a lot of experience with computing in a global context, which is one of the reasons I was able to serve as a AP Reader for Computer Science Principles. That course broadly addresses global impacts, and forces students to think deeply about the function and limitations of computers.

            <p>
              My job experience at TomTom also gave me experience with this knowledge standard. As a developer of hardware and software for car navigation, the company often pushed us to think broadly about where we could push the capabilites of our devices, and the different applications of our software. At a smaller scale, we were constantly forced to push the limits of the quality software we were developing to handle every new and strange situation which our business customers would complain about.

              The social and ethical implications of computers and their related technology
            </h4>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>As the father of three teenagers and now as a full time teacher, the ethical implications of computing is a topic always on my mind. Reaching back farther than the early days of computing, the ethics of technology has always been a domain where the decisions made by adults have a lasting impact on the lives of our children. A primary goal of my teaching is to help young people see the impacts of the decisions they make. As spiderman reminds my students via the large color poster in my classroom: "with great power comes great responsibility." This is especially true in the domain of technology. We explore this directly in class during preparation for the Explore PT, which is part of the AP exam for Computer Science Principles, by researching the harmful effects and security risks of computing innovations.</p>
            <p>One of the structural actions I've been able to take to support this is to introduce the new AP Computer Science Principles course at the high school where I work. This course is an important step towards expanding ethical thinking amongst teenagers because its learning goals include "Big Idea 7: Global Impact". In its first year the enrollment in this course was 6 students, with all of those students acheiving AP exam scores high enough to earn credit at UVM. This year one of my students is building an application to manage a shared Twitter account which will help us share and discuss current events related to the Big Ideas of AP Computer Science Principles.</p>
            <p>An important social aspect of computing is gender imbalance in the tech industry. In a small way I try to correct this through recruiting for my high school courses. This year, with a focus on increasing the enrollment of female students in the computer science classes I teach, the enrollment in AP Computer Science Principles is up to 9 students, 5 of which are female. Across all four of my programming and computer science classes I teach, 25 of my 44 total students are new to computing, with 44% of those new students being female. One of my female students was <a href="https://www.aspirations.org/user/120361">recently recognized</a> as a regional winner of the Aspirations award from the National Center for Women and Information Technology.</p>

            <p>Undergraduate and graduate work, then technical work experience at NOAA and TomTom gave me exposure to many sub-disciplines of computer science, especially spatial databases, python and java programming languages, and the complexities of large software engineering projects. My experience with spatial data began by carrying a large-backpack mounted GPS antennae around my college campus in the 1990s, exploring the data analysis capabilites of this technology at a time when the US government was still intentionally introducing error into GPS signals for security reasons (<a href="https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/sa/data/" >see more linked here</a>). My studies in spatial data continued in the Environmental Analysis program in graduate school, and further still while I built a spatial database of derelict vessels impacting coral reefs when I worked for NOAA in 2001.
            </p>
            <p>Most of my work during my 10 years at TomTom was related to spatial databases, and especially about maintaining the integrity and quality of spatial data. This gave me experience with the concepts, vocabulary and issues in the programming languages I used for data analysis. Additionally my role as a Product Owner (job title: Expert Specifications Engineer) gave me responsibilities for directing the work of scrum teams working on software engineering projects.</p>

While the majority of my work was in support of engineering scrum teams, one project that I managed and implemented on my own was called "Linqed". This was an internal website that pulled data from numerous sources to provide employees with a variety of technical information about the quality specifications of TomTom maps. I worked with stakeholders to design and modify the Linqed software. I managed the implementation on an internal server, and was continuously debugging the software based on testing done by myself and by end-users.</p>
            <p>I carried this software engineering process over to my work at WUHS by developing a tool to connect my course planning notes in Emacs to my class website on github. I published the source code for this project on github.</p>

            <p>I'm always looking for ways to help students practice being active consumers of content. When reading, I encourage marking up the text with underlines, explanation points, question marks, and comments in the margin. This is part of the reason I decided to not buy textbooks for my classes, instead favoring hole-punched photocopies that the students can write on. I also assign online readings and prefer interactive online textbooks like the AP Computer Science A textbook at Runestone Interactive, which has questions and coding exercises embedded directly in the reading, or Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code online text which embeds small runnable code samples. When possible I assign videos through the wedsite called EdPuzzle, which allows me to embed questions in other people's YouTube videos, providing quick and easy formative assessment.</p>
            <p>I take care to select and sequence instructional activities into meaningful courses for students at various levels.</p>

            <p>Assessment in computer science classes must cover more than just content recall. There are lots of design considerations that we all take into account when writing code, and these decisions can easily made the difference between good and bad software. I design learning activities that give students opportunities to make these decisions, and I look closely at these software quality attributes in when evaluating student work. This is based on years at TomTom working on software being graded for quality attributes by TIOBE (<a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tqi/definition/">see more linked here</a>).</p>
            <p>My students work on software projects under the umbrella of "Woodstock Computer Science Products". This is an informal organization of student projects that (a) are useful for people other than the student developers, and (b) have a lifespan longer than a single project or class. Most of these project are done in student teams, and most of these projects have milestones that one team work on, then the project is passed on to another student team who continues to maintain and improve the product. Students maintain scrum boards for each team. One important outcome of a team's final work on their portion of the project is to create or update documentation for future maintainers of the product.

              With respect to testing, I start my introductory students immediately with the <a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org">Bootstrap curriculum</a>, which uses the concept of "Examples" to include unit tests directly in the students runnable code.

            <p>When students work with programming languages, the need for good communication is right there in the word <em>language</em>. My classroom culture, and its physical setup, are oriented towards fostering frequent communication amongst students. Most programming projects are done with partners. Many analysis tasks are done in small groups around student whiteboards. I keep verbal prompts for students on the wall, and refer to them often (ie. "Don't forget to ask Luke's question...") while pointing up to a poster I had written earlier in the year after I heard Luke ask a good question.</p>
            <p>This culture of communication and its related teacher moves are largely based on an intensive, long-term professional development series my school is offering to the Math Department. This professional development includes eight full days of workshops in a school year which are focused on student communication about mathematics. The school decided to support me in these workshops even though I don't teach any math courses because they recognize the parallel importance of communication in computer science classes.</p>

              I co-teach a class called "IDEA: Innovation, Design, Engineering, Action", in which students design and build physical and technical products to solve specific problems. These are substantial, semester-long projects. Students publish their projects online at an IDEA class website.</p>
            <p>
              The students' first project was to enter a sculpture in the town's annual "Light Garden". They built a physical, creative answer to the question 'How can give someone the experience of natural light phenomena that only exist in other parts of the world?'. Their sculpture represented a wave with bioluminescent algae crashing on a shore next to an erupting volcano. In a software component of the project, they created a Twitter account for the sculpture, and invited visitors to tweet at the sculpture. One of the students wrote node.js code that responded to these tweets with flashing lights on the sculpture and a tweeted reply with a random fact about natural light phenomena.
            </p>
            <p>
              Part of the grant that is funding the new Innovation Lab in our building where the IDEA class meets was to also fund an Innovation Study Group. This group took a trip to other schools on the East Coast that are models in developing creative mindsets in their students. We've been sharing our findings in blog posts and in short slides at faculty meetings. A couple of the group leaders compiled the full group findings into a report for the district board. The purpose of this study group is to identify short-term improvements in our school that would improve student opportunities for design thinking, as well as to spearhead the development of a long-term Master Plan for the school buildings and programming.
